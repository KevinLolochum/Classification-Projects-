# Defaulters using NN

This repo contains a defaulters classification project.
I use information about customers such as education, sex, marital-status, previous credit balance to predict whether they will default in a specific month.

I compare the performance of simple classification models with ANNs and the results are shown. ANNs perform slightly beteer than simple models.

# Classifier      Score
GNB               - 79%
BaggingClassifier - 81.4%
XGB Classifiers   - 81.7%
ANNs              - 81.7%
